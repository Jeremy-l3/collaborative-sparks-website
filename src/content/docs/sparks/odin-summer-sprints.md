title: Odin Summer Sprints 2025 🚀
description: Let’s learn fast, build useful things, and have some summer fun!
---
*June → August 2025  ·  Short, focused, and fun*

---
## Why (Purpose)
Put our *teal‑style* governance, collective skills, and diverse forms of capital to work on real, bite‑sized experiments that strengthen decentralized operations and create visible value for the wider Cardano & open‑source community.

## What (Scope)
- **Micro‑sprints** of **5–14 days**  
- 1–2 work‑in‑progress experiments at any moment  
- Concrete deliverables (code, docs, site, tokenomics prototype, etc.)  
- Rapid consent‑based decisions, quick feedback loops

## First Ideas on Deck
| Idea                                     | Quick win                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collaborative Sparks website**         | Publish a knowledge hub for self‑management & collaboration patterns |
| **Self‑Management & Collaboration blog** | Launch and seed first articles                                       |
| **Tokenomics / incentive prototype**     | Test small‑scale reward mechanics on Cardano pre‑prod                |
| **Other suggestions welcome**            | Propose during Sprint Planning                                       |

*(Pitch your idea via the `Proposal` issue template.)*

## How We Work

| Tool                | Purpose                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Issues**   | One issue = one task / proposal                                              |
| **GitHub Projects** | Sprint board with “To Do → Doing → Done” columns and date‑bounded iterations |
| **Pull Requests**   | Consent process: merge after required approvals                              |
| **Discussions**     | Async brainstorming & questions                                              |
| **Discord**         | Daily stand‑ups / voice huddles                                              |

## Sprint Rhythm

1. **Sprint Planning** (30 min) — choose next experiment(s) & define “Done”.  
2. **Daily Check‑ins** (15 min, optional async update).  
3. **Sprint Review & Retro** (30 min) — demo results, capture learnings, decide rewards.  
4. **Repeat** until end of August.

## Roles (lightweight)

- **Sprint Lead** (rotates) — keeps board tidy, hosts meetings.  
- **Contributors** — grab tasks, open PRs, request help openly.  
- **Reviewers** — at least two approvals required for merge.

## Getting Started

1. **Join the repo** → accept invite.  
2. **Read the open proposals** in `proposals/` or Issues.  
3. **Add yourself to the Contributors list** in `README.md`.  
4. **Comment or open a proposal issue** if you have an experiment idea.  
5. **Jump into Sprint Planning call** (see `docs/schedule.md`)!
