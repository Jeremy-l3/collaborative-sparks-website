title: Describing Domains for Clarity
---

Create abundant shared meaning and enable autonomy, by establishing strong clarity.

# What is a Domain?

Simply put, it's a ***group or role, formed for a specific purpose***.  Creating a clear expression of that purpose, and certain operational aspects of its plan or approach, can be a big help.  

A great domain definition ***lets contributors know what to expect and how they can respond to whatever situations arise***.

### Clarity is Crucial

For any domain, having very clear expressions of purpose, intended outcomes, and big-picture vision creates a picture and includes a frame for contributors to hold in mind as they work to fulfill their shared meaning.

> #### Sidebar: Domains, delegators, and nested domains
> We refer to a domain created autonomously as a ***self-sourced*** domain.  We feel driven to deeply support people having such ambitious visions, where **clarity of intention** is so critical for impactful achievement.
> 
> A ***nested domain*** is created when people working for a shared purpose (in a ***delegating domain***) feel a need to establish a new zone of independent / autonomous action.  A delegation agreement is used to form up a description of the new domain they create.  Typically, they should easily find consent for the shared purpose driving that new domain.

## How to Describe a Domain?
### Develop Tensions  into Drivers

This activity starts with the essential problem that drives you to make a change.  Our tension/driver development worksheets will help you transform that first expression of difficulty into a concise expression of purpose that can cover a wide variety of intended activities, along with all kinds of work you didn't know how to expect.

### Raise Constraints, Dependencies, and Resources

Typically, a delegating group establishes resources, guidelines, and constraints, consensually with a nested domain, in order to more ***clearly define the zone of autonomy***. 

***Constraints* establish preset boundaries, to enable freedom to act independently and responsibly**.  Constraints can include ethical values, practical limits sourced from real-world conditions, or they can follow concerns raised in scope of a delegation agreement.  Recognized risks can provide a source of desirable constraints.

**Dependencies** are a special type of enabler, because they represent both a **resource** and a **constraint**.   As a resource, they make intended collaborations explicit: "*...group X is supporting you with skill S*".  As a constraint, they help a domain's contributors avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and costs of closing skill gaps.  

> Use dependencies to ***proactively guard against siloing*** and reveal available Resources

**Resources** are provided and/or requested as part of any evolving delegation agreement, to help satisfy any needs required for the success of a domain's purpose.  Money, tooling, and collaborating teams are some prime examples.

> ##### Resourcing in Self-Sourced Domains
>
> Not all of these factors of interdependence are available in a self-sourced domain.  Because of this, the ***need for clarity in expressing drivers is magnified***.  Intended outcomes and requirements are particularly relevant.

***Any domain can additionally recognize resources they have intrinsically***, and you might be surprised how valuable these can be when they're brought into focus.

### Recognize Success Factors

Responsibilities, Deliverables and needed Skills are a few important types of success factors.  By describing expectations of these kinds, ***people working in, needing help from, or collaborating with your group or role can be really clear about what to expect and what is expected***.   

> Contributors with ***clearly defined success factors** can make meaningful progress* on their shared purpose.

## Validation: Consent and Refinement

To complete group or domain formation, seek consent, not by asking permission. Instead, seek out any important feedback needed for you to ***know your domain description expresses what you intend, and that it makes sense to anyone who you need involved***.

> The consent process gives you early opportunity to make any important improvements right away.  Socialize the domain description ***to see where it was missing crucial clarity***.

<!-- TODO: link: who should consent?: Involve those who are affectied/Equivalence -->
<!-- TODO: link to more consent content -->
#### Where to draw the line of good enough?
> A ***Less-than-Minimum Viable*** domain description may be needed if you want more rigorous validation, such as with customers and prospects.  In such cases, it's fine to allow a "good-enough" description of purpose to proceed.

When the plan looks like it may be ***safe enough to inspire your next responsible activity*** on-mission, that's how you know you got consent.  No need to wait - let's go!


## Keys to Achievement

Any group or role that's working in the world will need to deal with whatever arises.  In successful organizations, people habitually *focus on value*, *act responsively* to conditions, and *recognize difficulties* as tensions.  

When needed, they *develop those tensions* into drivers describing what's important, to *enhance clarity* and *create shared meaning*.  They *try things*, they *see what happens*, and they *learn from it*.  

Then they wake up on a new day, and ***keep doing it all again***.  ☀️ GM!
