Create abundant shared meaning and enable autonomy, by establishing strong clarity.

### What is a Domain?

Simply put, it's a group or role, formed for a specific purpose.  Creating a clear expression of that purpose, and certain operational aspects, helps contributors know what to expect and how to respond to whatever situations arise.

People working in one domain can create new domains in order to delegate autonomy through an explicit agreement, and that agreement is a description of the new domain.

## Step 1: Tension/Driver development

This activity starts with the essential problem that drives you to make a change.  Our tension/driver development worksheets will help you transform that first expression of difficulty into a concise expression of purpose that can cover a wide variety of intended activities, along with all kinds of work you didn't know how to expect.

## Step 2: Resources, Dependencies and Constraints

By establishing clarity about what responsibilities are reserved by constraint, and which are being provided outside this domain (for example, by a delegator).

## Step 3: Success Factors

Responsibilities, deliverables and needed skills are a few important types of success factors.  By describing expectations of these kinds, people working in, needing help from, or collaborating with your group or role can be really clear about what to expect and what is expected.  

Following these forms of guidance, they should be able to make meaningful progress on the purpose.

## Step 4: Consent

To complete group or domain formation, seek consent, not by asking permission but by expressing what you intend and seeking any critical feedback needed for your domain's description to make sense to anyone who you need to be involved.

The consent process helps you find what makes sense and gives you early opportunity to make any important improvements.
