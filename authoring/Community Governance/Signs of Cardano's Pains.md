### Where Pains Show Themselves (with evidence)

As a network of individuals, each participating in networks of innovation and focused on practical dynamics of impact and effectiveness, ODIN continues to observe and contribute in our own ways to the development of healthy governance at all levels, from individual skills to overall culture, from macro-level direction down to micro-interactions.

We've recognized that for a network to change, it needs to be able to observe itself; as part of ODIN's purpose, we believe that gathering signals, developing them into insights and showing them as a metaphorical mirror for the community can be a high value form of contribution to the real potential of the Cardano community.

Here are some of the observations we have gathered, showing pains emerging from this time of growth and development.

#### Awareness and Participation: Thin and Uneven

CIP-1694 formalized roles such as DReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee and types of governance actions, but community comprehension and consistent role-taking remain spotty — classic “new structure, old habits.” 

See [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions/), [docs.cardano.org](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/governance-overview))  

#### Mediation is Under Strain
##### Liminal Stewardship

The Interim/Fully-elected Constitutional Committee is tasked with interpreting constitutionality, yet perceptions of neutrality and the balance among power centers (Foundation, Intersect, IOG, community) are contested — leading to legitimacy friction during reviews and elections. 

See [https://cardanofoundation.org](https://cardanofoundation.org/governance), [Cexplorer](https://cexplorer.io/article/cardano-s-new-constitutional-committee-a-triumph-for-community-governance) 

#### Motivation Blurred by Institutional Gravity

Intersect’s MBO framing promises member-led direction, but some DRep/community commentary questions alignment between budget lines and that mission — an indicator that collective “why” and “how” aren’t consistently felt at the edge. 

See [intersectmbo.org](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/cardano-cip-1694-explained), [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/drep-feedback-on-budget/143448)

#### Reciprocity Failure in Budgeting Process

When large actors shape timelines, proposals, or narratives, smaller contributors experience the process as extractive rather than mutual, even while “consultation” materials emphasize openness. This asymmetry, the failure of recipirocity (two-way flow) is visible in budget forums/AMAs and community recaps. 

See [committees.docs.intersectmbo.org](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-budget-committee/archive/2025-budget-process), [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/budget-committee-public-meetings-and-amas-summaries/143424), [intersectmbo.org](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/demystifying-cardanos-first-annual-budget-process-how-to-get-involved)

#### Unstable Ingredients of Trust

Openness & Care (key ingredients for trust) wobble under public contention. Disputes about influence—especially around the Foundation’s posture—fuel defensive communication and erode psychological safety, even as official channels stress neutrality and transparency.  

See [https://cardanofoundation.org](https://cardanofoundation.org/governance), [BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/hoskinson-criticizes-cardano-foundation/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1hcushc/whistleblower_allegations_about_the_cardano/) Note: reports and commentary vary; linking to both perspectives.

#### Self-Synchronization is Patchy

##### Lack of coherence between localized initiatives and "system-level" initiative

The system allows anyone to submit governance actions, but coordination across DReps, SPOs, CC, and MBO committees frequently lags the cadence of decisions — producing “macro decisions, micro confusion.”

See [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions/), [April Update from Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/intersect-development-update-57-april-11) 

### How this aligns with our Problem Statement

An honest description of Cardano governance—“limping along, iterating (but in which direction?), struggling to deliver meaningful change”—is the textbook result when:

- governance scaffolding outpaces shared practice,  
 
- budget power and narrative power aren’t reciprocally checked, and  

- spaces for mediation, reflection, and group agreements aren’t ritualized at the same level as voting mechanics.  

---
## Bottom Line
The on-chain framework offered by CIP-1694 is impressive—and still young. 

The frictions we’re feeling are not aberrations; they’re predictable collaboration gaps that our pattern library was designed to diagnose and treat. If Cardano routinely pairs mechanics (CIP-1694, budgets) with rituals (mediation, reciprocity, reflection, agreements), the network can iterate toward legitimacy and shared value, not away from it. 

The evidence suggests the need—and the opportunity—to do exactly that, now.
