# ðŸ§¾ The User Consent Compensation Model  
*A lightweight contract between builder and user*

In many decentralized communities, compensation often feels like a guessing game. Builders donâ€™t always know what their work is worth, and users arenâ€™t always invited to say what itâ€™s worth to them. The **User Consent Compensation Model** is a new approach we're experimenting with â€” one that tries to bring clarity, fairness, and flexibility to how value gets rewarded.

Instead of waiting for a grant or applying for approval from a centralized treasury, the builder makes the first move. They create a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) aimed at solving a specific problem for a real user or community node. Then, they ask for consent to a compensation proposal.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Present the Work**  
   The builder presents a working prototype (not just an idea) and explains what it does, who it's for, and how much they're asking in return.

2. **Negotiate Terms with Users**  
   The proposal is shared with a user or group of users â€” not a boss or fund manager, but a peer or funding party who sees the value and agrees to test it. Importantly, these users give **prior consent** to a compensation amount, based on a shared understanding of whatâ€™s being delivered.

3. **Use the Product**  
   Over a set period of time, users try the product in a real-world scenario. Only those who actually use the tool are invited to evaluate it.

4. **Make a Decision by Consent**  
   At the end of the trial, the user group evaluates whether the builder met the agreed-upon value. Using a Sociocracy 3.0-style **consent decision-making process**, they decide whether to release the proposed payment â€” or suggest modifications, partial payment, or follow-up work.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Try This?

- **Aligns incentives** between builders and users.
- Encourages builders to *start with a solution*, not a sales pitch.
- Shifts power away from centralized funding and toward **direct relationships**.
- Brings **human consent** and conversation into the compensation loop.

---

## ðŸ›‘ What Could Go Wrong?

- Builders carry **delivery risk** if users walk away or reject the value.
- Evaluation could be biased or inconsistent unless guardrails (like rubrics or escrow) are in place.
- Participation must happen in a **high-trust context** â€” this isnâ€™t designed for anonymous bounties.

## ðŸ§ª Try It This Way

- Build a simple prototype â€” a tool, guide, workflow, etc.
- Identify a real user or peer who might benefit.
- Propose a compensation amount and invite them to **consent to a test**.
- After use, hold a brief consent-based check-in: *Did it solve the problem? Was the value there? Should the funds be released?*
- Reflect together on how to improve the product â€” or the model itself.

This model isn't about extracting value â€” it's about meeting real needs in real time. Itâ€™s not a bounty. Itâ€™s not a grant. Itâ€™s a **collaborative contract**, grounded in mutual respect and tested through shared experience.

We're curious to see how it feels. If you try it â€” or tweak it â€” let us know. After all, compensation is not just a transaction. It's part of the culture we're building.
