### **Context**

In group work, systems change, and complex collaboration, people often come together across lines of difference—cultural, organizational, ideological, or personal. These spaces require high trust, vulnerability, and a deep sense of shared humanity to function well. But at first, most of what we know about others is **external**: their title, their tone, their affiliations, their output.

### **Problem**

When we only see each other from the outside, we fall into:

- **Premature judgments**, projecting assumptions onto people’s actions or words.

- A tendency to reduce people to **roles, labels, or categories**.

- Lack of empathy, especially across unfamiliar experiences or identities.

- Hesitation to take relational risks, share concerns, or reveal uncertainties.

- Collaboration that remains **functional but shallow**, missing emotional depth and trust.


Without insight into each other’s **internal context**—the values, histories, and experiences that shape who we are—misunderstanding is common, and trust remains fragile.

---

### **Forces**

- People crave connection, but often feel unsafe being vulnerable in professional or cross-boundary spaces.

- First impressions are often incorrect, yet quickly become sticky.

- We tend to judge others based on behavior, but ourselves based on context.

- Deep trust cannot be built through facts and data alone; it requires emotional resonance.

### **Solution**

**Invite the sharing of stories—especially personal stories that reveal values, lived experiences, and motivations. Use story as a bridge to internal context, humanizing others and creating the foundation for courageous connection.**

This means:

- Making space for people to tell **who they are**, not just what they do.

- Listening with openness and curiosity, not to assess or fix, but to understand.

- Valuing storytelling as a **relational technology**, not just an expressive act.

- Recognizing that story-sharing is **voluntary, intimate, and vulnerable**—and must be held with care.

- Using storytelling not to drive agreement, but to cultivate empathy and **relational trust**


Stories reveal what structure alone cannot: our shared humanness beneath our different roles.

### **Resulting Context**

- Participants experience **deeper connection** and are more willing to take interpersonal risks.

- Assumptions give way to **understanding and compassion**.

- The group becomes more resilient in moments of tension or disagreement.

- Trust is built not through forced cohesion, but through **voluntary relational openness**.

- Collaboration becomes **warmer, more grounded, and more capable of handling complexity**.
