### **Context**

In diverse networks, coalitions, or teams—particularly those working across lines of identity, geography, or discipline—**participants bring different histories, worldviews, and ways of contributing**. The vitality of a network often depends on its ability to bridge these differences and cultivate the unique gifts of its members.

However, when dominant cultural norms are left unexamined, they can **invisibly shape whose contributions are valued**, whose presence is normalized, and who feels safe enough to show up fully.

---

### **Problem**

When appreciation is not intentionally practiced:

- Contributions that don’t fit the dominant mold are **overlooked or subtly devalued**.

- Participants feel pressure to **conform or perform** in ways that mask their identities and dampen their strengths.

- The culture becomes **transactional or extractive**, focused on utility rather than mutual regard.

- Trust withers, especially across lines of difference.

- The network **misses out on the creativity, connection, and resilience** that emerge from real diversity.


In the absence of appreciation, diversity becomes a risk instead of a strength.

### **Forces**

- Dominant cultural norms (e.g., professionalism, productivity-centered mindsets) often operate **unconsciously**, setting the baseline for what’s seen as "normal" or "effective."

- People from marginalized identities may already carry **risk, trauma, or exhaustion** into the space.
    
- Genuine appreciation can be confused with flattery, tokenism, or sentimentality.
    
- Structures of hierarchy or urgency can crowd out space for **slowness, recognition, and relationality**.

### **Solution**

**Practice appreciation deliberately and consistently**—not as a performance, but as an ethic.

This means:

- **Accept people as they are**, without requiring assimilation.

- **Acknowledge and elevate diverse ways of knowing, relating, and creating**—including nonverbal, intuitive, emotional, ancestral, or place-based forms.

- **Decenter dominant norms** (e.g. whiteness, formality, urgency) to make room for pluralism.

- **Create space for public expressions of gratitude and recognition**—not only at the end of events, but as part of the daily life of the network.

- Ask regularly: _Who or what are you appreciating right now?_

- Make room for mutual appreciation that is **specific, genuine, and affirming**, even in moments of difficulty.


In doing so, appreciation becomes a social nutrient—a way to reinforce **relational trust**, support **reciprocity**, and invite the full presence of each person.

### **Resulting Context**

- People feel **seen, respected, and free to contribute their full selves**.

- The group becomes more **relationally resilient**, able to navigate disagreement without eroding trust.

- Contributions multiply in both number and diversity.

- Trust builds not just between individuals, but within the culture itself.

- The group learns to thrive not in spite of difference, but because of it.
