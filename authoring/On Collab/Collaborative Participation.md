### Context
In decentralized systems such as sociocratic organizations, communities of practice, or distributed networks, power and decision-making are shared across many roles and individuals. These systems rely not just on action or engagement, but on a deeper layer of **participation**—the way individuals show up, relate, and attune to collective processes.

***

### Problem
When participation is left undefined or assumed, people enter into decentralized spaces with varying and often conflicting expectations. This leads to:

- **Uneven presence and voice**—some people dominate, while others fade into the background.

- **Unspoken assumptions** about who should contribute and when, which create misunderstandings and unmet needs.

- **Confusion or frustration** when people "show up" but don't know how to participate meaningfully.

- **Decisions and processes** that feel hollow or exclusive, despite being structurally open.

In these cases, decentralization alone is not enough; **shared meaning around participation is missing**.

***

### Forces
- People bring different experiences of leadership, hierarchy, and inclusion into new systems.

- Participation is shaped by cultural, emotional, and psychological dynamics—not just structure.

- Without clear expectations, people default to old habits or withdraw entirely.

- Too much structure can stifle emergence; too little can create ambiguity and disengagement.

- Presence, attention, and relational commitment are hard to measure but essential to collective intelligence.

***

### Solution
***Therefore:*** **Cultivate collaborative participation by making participation itself a conscious, co-created practice—not just an implicit condition.**

This involves:
- **Surfacing and naming assumptions** about what it means to participate in this system. 

- **Inviting reflection and clarity**: Why am I here? What am I being asked to hold, not just do?  

- **Establishing shared agreements** around presence, attention, voice, and availability. 

- **Making space for multiple modes of participation**—including listening, sensing, documenting, questioning, and supporting.  

- **Regularly reviewing and evolving participation norms**, especially as the system grows or changes.  

Participation becomes less about just _doing_, and more about _being in relationship_ with others, the work, and the system as a whole.

***

### Resulting Context
- People understand how they are expected—and invited—to show up.

- Contributions become more thoughtful, inclusive, and aligned with shared purpose.

- Diversity of thought and style is welcomed without sacrificing coherence.

- The system becomes resilient and adaptive, rooted in **presence and mutual responsibility**, not just permissions and roles.
